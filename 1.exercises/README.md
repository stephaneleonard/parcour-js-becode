- Dur√©e : 5 jours

## Learning objectives

At the end of this challenge you should:

* be able to code using *JavaScript*

## The mission

This folder consist of 73 exercises within 11 sections. Don't be scared by the
number though, most of these exercises are very short and focus on particular
aspect of *JavaScript*. However, if you find yourself unable to solve a problem
don't hesitate to try the next one, you can always come back later.

Follow this [introduction](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/156vrNVBSOSy_YdHRKbaoqXfr3GALC2dtZFbaU-pR5eI/edit#slide=id.g35f391192_04) at the beginning of the challenge, once you
finished _section 5_ you should also read this one on the [DOM](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zcucIJ-y8xyT5rjCE5hpPjBWq-RjIBusuXvIygfnqPQ/edit?usp=sharing).

Once you've been acquainted with *JavaScript* you should start completing the
exercises. Each one of them is contained in a sub-folder of the appropriate
section and contain an _index.html_ and a _script.js_, further explanations can
be found within said _index.html_.

### Instructions

* clone this repository
* check the _index.html_
* complete the exercises within the _script.js_

NOTE: In the end every exercise must be done, but the ninth section is composed
of harder challenges. They are worth doing and are mainly here as a syntheses of
the previous parts.

## To know

### ES2015+ ?

You might quickly notice, while you research, that there's an _ancient_ and a
_new_ *JavaScript* named _ES2015_ or _ES2016_, even _ES2017_, etc... These are
new standards, you just have to remember that the current accepted standard is
*ES2015*.

#### Section 11

For the exercises using fetch you will need a *REST API*. We once again got you
covered with a little script to run said *API* in *local*, follow the step
below:

* open a terminal
* go to the folder _exercises_ 
* run `npm run api`

From there you will have the *REST API* running on _localhost_ on the port 3000.
